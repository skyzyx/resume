Dear Hiring Manager,

{Reasons for interest in the role}

{What I bring to the role}

Thank you for your consideration.

The résumé I submitted is one that is optimized for ATS systems, however it contains a link at the top which links to a résumé that is intended for review by humans. I want to call this out so that it isn't inadvertently overlooked.

While I know that live coding is a popular approach for evaluating engineers, I have pretty significant live coding anxiety. Live coding will always present me at my worst, not my best. My hope is that you will be willing to evaluate my coding and project ability by reviewing the list of projects in my résumé, giving me a take-home test (with coding assistants disabled, of course), or having me walk through I project I ran or wrote.
