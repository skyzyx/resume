## Work Experience

### [McGraw Hill] — Remote (since COVID), previously Seattle, WA

> McGraw Hill is a _learning science_ company which produces textbooks, digital learning tools, and adaptive technology to enhance learning. It is one of the “big three” educational publishers in the U.S.

#### Principal Engineer, Cloud Center of Excellence (January 2024—October 2024)

* Joined a team whose mission was to provide guidance and support in the cloud journey of the entire organization.
* Started development on v2 of a project which scanned AWS accounts for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. Goal was to reduce an [AWS Well-Architected] review from 2 weeks to 2 hours with automated scans, enabling more reviews annually (10 → 100).
* Managed the migration from [CentOS] to [Amazon Linux] before the CentOS end-of-life date.
* Proposed best practices, guardrails, and security measures to ensure a secure and efficient cloud environment.
* Identified opportunities to extend the security measures and guardrails devised for AWS to other cloud platforms.

#### Principal Cloud and Platform Engineer (June 2020—January 2024)

* Led the team who supported all SRE and product engineering teams, scaling core platforms and services as every school in America transitioned to online learning during the COVID-19 lockdowns.
* Authored/edited over 1,800 [Confluence] documents with the goal of reducing _tribal knowledge_.
* Partnered with Enterprise Architecture and [AWS Professional Services] to deploy [Control Tower][AWS Control Tower] and [Identity Center][AWS Identity Center], resulting in lowered costs and improved control over account guardrails.
* Managed the Base [AMI] program (server disk images). Leveraged insights from [CIS], security patching, and internal needs to develop a unified build pipeline integrating best practices. Reduced time-to-boot, and eliminated engineering toil (1 → 10).
* Spearheaded the [Artifactory] Rebuild project. Ran the project from inception to completion, including the majority of development. Directed effort across ~80 teams and ~300 services to complete the project.
* Resolved all technology blockers preventing migration lower-cost [ARM64] CPUs, opening the door for ~$450k/year in cost savings.
* Led dozens of smaller projects, offered guidance to engineers on best practices, and documented knowledge.

#### Engineering Manager, Site Reliability (October 2018—June 2020)

* Managed a team of four, while working to level-up the team's technical skills and leadership capabilities. Conducted regular 1:1s, performance reviews, and career development discussions.
* Revamped the SRE interview process to prioritize a 70/30 focus on software engineering (Dev) and systems operations (Ops). Emphasized leadership qualities, bias for action, and high curiosity.
* Led the [_Site Reliability Engineering_][SRE] (SRE) team in addressing macro problems affecting engineering, empowering self-service.
* Established a process for maintaining reusable [Terraform] modules which teams leveraged to compose infrastructure.

#### Staff Software Engineer (October 2016—October 2018)

* Led the development of Tier-1 services within the educational content authoring pipeline, leveraging technologies such as [REST], [GraphQL], API design, [Amazon ECS] (similar to [Kubernetes]), [Docker], [Terraform], [ePubs][EPUB], and security best practices.
* Led the development of the authoring component of the [SmartBook 2.0 product][SB2], and the internal system which indexes authored content, builds ePubs, and encodes images/video for the ePub CDN using [ffmpeg].
* Established the technical direction of these projects, promoted adoption across the organization, published comprehensive documentation, and offered ongoing integration guidance.
* Accelerated the adoption of CI/CD, rapid deployment practices, and Docker containers, shortening the feedback loop for developers and increasing the reliability of deployments.

### [WePay] — Redwood City, CA

> WePay is an online payment service provider which provides “payments for platforms”, where examples of platforms are GoFundMe, Care.com, and Xbox. JPMorgan Chase acquired WePay in October 2017.

#### DevOps Engineer (April 2015—September 2016)

* Led a cross-company initiative to upgrade the monolithic application from [PHP] 5.4 to PHP 5.6 (the latest at the time). Facilitated cross-team collaboration among all major engineering teams and QA departments to achieve results.
* Initiated a program to automate the creation of base server images for cloud servers. This allowed new servers to boot and begin serving traffic ~75% faster.
* Invested in monitoring and alerting systems to prevent customer-facing issues ([New Relic], [Grafana]).

#### Senior API Engineer (April 2014—April 2015)

* Led the company’s [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com) security program, coordinating across teams to address security issues.
* Built a local development environment for engineering teams using [Vagrant]. Eliminated "works on my machine", and reduced new engineer onboarding time from 2 weeks to 1 day (measured by when a new employee could make their first commit).
* Expanded WePay’s payment security offerings by designing MFA-as-a-Service (U.S. patent filing [US15042104]).

### [Amazon Web Services] — Seattle, WA

> Amazon Web Services provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis.

#### Web Development Engineer II (March 2010—April 2014)

* Created the [AWS SDK for PHP], enabling AWS to reach millions of new developers.
* Initiated the creation of [AWS SDK for PHP] v2 to address changes in the PHP language and growth of AWS services.
* Led one of the first teams to provide reusable UI building blocks for the [AWS Management Console], by collaborating directly with the AWS Design team.
* Invested in increased transparency, better communication, and improved tooling for developers. [[Examples](https://github.com/skyzyx/resume/blob/master/amazon-specifics.md)]
