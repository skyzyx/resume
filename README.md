## Work Experience & Notable Projects

### [Northwood Labs](https://github.com/northwood-labs) ‚Äî Colorado

#### Owner (January 2024‚ÄîPresent)

Northwood Labs is an incubator for security and reliability tooling. (Presently a _side-hustle_, not a full-time gig.)

It is a tiny company based in Colorado who thinks that software engineering, site reliability, operations, and cybersecurity are all parts of the same whole. We want to empower teams to build quality software and reliable services, teach where there are knowledge gaps, and make it possible for every user to have access to the best in security.

Historically, most of the tools built to address these areas have done a poor job of integrating across all relevant disciplines, and can also cost a small fortune in order to help teams ensure their products and services are well-built, reliable, and secure.

### [McGraw Hill](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mcgraw-hill-education) ‚Äî Remote (since COVID), previously Seattle, WA

#### Enterprise Architect, Cloud Center of Excellence (January 2024‚ÄîOctober 2024)

Assumed a role influencing the technical direction of the entire organization. Collaborated closely with members of the Cloud Center of Excellence, Reliability Engineering, Cybersecurity, Networking, and Application Development teams to prevent ‚ÄúIvory Tower Syndrome.‚Äù Ensured a focus on real-world, actionable feedback and provided strategic direction aligned with practical needs.

* **Documentation and Training:** Continued to ensure that people could continue to learn about new topics without requiring any specific human to become a bottleneck.

* **AWS Organizations and Control Tower:** Continued to be involved in the oversight and direction of our AWS stack, security, guardrails, and more.

* **Cross-Cloud Collaboration:** Collaborated with peers focusing on Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Deepened understanding of our cloud fabric to enable high-performance networking across multiple clouds. Identified opportunities to extend the security measures and guardrails developed for AWS to other cloud platforms. Trained peers on the effective use of Terraform for cloud management.

#### Principal Cloud and Platform Engineer (June 2020‚ÄîJanuary 2024)

Transitioned from Engineering Manager to a strategic technical leadership role, focusing on projects I'd initiated. Planned the product roadmap for those projects and integrated solutions into our highly heterogeneous application ecosystem. By stepping away from direct personnel management, I was able to concentrate on providing technical leadership.

* **Documentation:** Prolific documentarian. Documentation is worth 50% of your grade.

* **Reliability Platform:** Products that I had personally pioneered (ECS-optimized Base AMI, Prism, Monitoring-as-Code, Terraform modules) became core pieces of our ‚Äúreliability platform‚Äù alongside off-the-shelf software/services such as [AWS Control Tower](https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/), [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/), [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprise), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Circle CI Enterprise](https://circleci.com/enterprise/), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io), and more.

* **Control Tower:** Partnered with McGraw Hill Enterprise Architecture and [AWS Professional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/) to deploy [AWS Control Tower](http://aws.amazon.com/controltower/) and [AWS Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/). Lowered costs and increased control over account guardrails. Enabled automated provisioning of new accounts, and developed smoke tests as a post-provisioning validation step.

* **Clarity in Complexity:** Collaborated on the deployment of guardrails across all AWS organizational units (OUs). Ensured clarity and traceability of code in a large and complex project. Worked with the team to understand implementation details thoroughly, then developed Lambda functions and CI code to track changes in Git commits to master/main. Created README and Confluence documentation with directed graphs and charts from DOT documents to visually simplify workflows and implementation details.

* **Base AMI program:** Leveraged insights from [Packer](https://www.packer.io), [CIS Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org), security patching, and the specific needs of internal AMI customers to develop a unified build pipeline integrating best practices. Implemented automatic development builds with unit and integration testing triggered on Git commits, and production builds with comprehensive package indexing on Git tags. Pre-installed and pre-configured agents for metrics and cybersecurity, incorporated automated security analysis scanning, and made Base AMIs available to all ¬± 200 AWS accounts. Achieved zero downtime across the organization by seamlessly rotating hosts to use the new AMIs. Adopted EC2 Image Builder and automated AMI rotations in the process.

* **Streamlining:** Integrated Terraform, Monitoring-as-Code, Base AMIs, and custom security tooling to empower application teams. Enabled deployment of Docker images with minimal configuration to Amazon ECS clusters, incorporating best practices, infrastructure monitoring, and operational tooling. Reduced overall costs by streamlining deployment processes.

* **Preventative automation:** Conducted comprehensive scans of Route 53 and other DNS providers to obtain a mapping of thousands of active websites. Developed and leveraged highly concurrent, scalable bots to fetch certificate data from each endpoint. Enabled faster rotation of expiring datacenter certificates by identifying both the certificates and their installation locations. Verified required DNS records for self-rotating _Amazon Certificate Manager_ certificates.

* **Prism:** Developed custom security and operational tooling where off-the-shelf tools wouldn't give us what we needed. Solution involved highly concurrent and dynamically-scalable nodes that would scan the AWS APIs to understand the current posture of ¬±200 AWS accounts. Made the data transparent to ALL engineers, enabling teams to be involved in improving their infrastructure stacks.

* **Self-hosted GitHub Actions runners:** Implemented Amazon EKS to deploy self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions within our GitHub Enterprise environment. Developed hourly smoke tests to validate the GitHub Actions runner environment and the imported actions for internal developers. Enhanced visibility and provided working examples to effectively leverage actions, improving overall developer efficiency.

* **Automation for Artifactory:** Rebuilt our Artifactory cluster with a ‚Äúcattle, not pets‚Äù approach. Dedicated Base AMI, rotated monthly. Migrated artifacts from NFS to S3, which significantly lowered costs. Rewrote configurations using Terraform to eliminate manual configurations. Moved service-user management into Terraform. This automation reduced human error, improved security posture, and increased consistency, leading to a better developer experience.

* **Custom Packages:** Streamlined the developer experience by consolidating all disparate Amazon ECR Docker image repositories into Artifactory. Reduced build times for virtual machines and Docker images by identifying commonly installed software and packaging them as pre-compiled `.rpm`, `.deb`, and `.apk` (Alpine Linux) packages. Enabled installation via the system's built-in package management system using Artifactory, resulting in faster, more reliable builds and mitigating issues like the [‚Äúleft-pad‚Äù problem](https://web.archive.org/web/20210824233536/https://www.davidhaney.io/npm-left-pad-have-we-forgotten-how-to-program/).

* **Token Vending Machine:** Developed a Token Vending Machine to enable continuous token and password rotation for our engineering teams, providing a "push-button, receive-token" solution. Leveraged AWS Secrets Manager, Lambda, KMS, IAM policies, and custom CLI software written in Go. Implemented the initial integration for service accounts in Artifactory.

* **ARM64 Adoption:** Anticipated the significance of ARM64 architecture following Apple's announcement of ARM64-based Apple silicon Macs in November 2020. Proactively addressed dependencies on Intel `x86_64` by updating custom package build pipelines for ARM64 compatibility. Implemented ARM64 runners for GitHub Actions and established ARM64 parity in Artifactory for remote repositories. Authored tutorials and hands-on documentation for utilizing Docker BuildKit to produce multi-platform container images. Prepared the organization for the adoption of AWS Graviton (ARM64) CPUs for cost optimization, ensuring all components were in place for seamless integration. This initiative also resolved issues faced by multi-platform development teams using both Intel Macs and Apple silicon Macs.

### CloudFusion (n√©e Tarzan) ‚Äî Open-Source Project

#### Creator and Developer (Early 2005‚ÄîMarch 2010)

* Developed CloudFusion, a fast and powerful PHP toolkit for rapidly building cloud-based web applications. Prioritized design decisions that enhanced performance, ease of use, and overall usability. Aimed to provide a high-performance developer toolkit for leveraging Amazon's cloud infrastructure, fostering community growth, and building useful, user-centric applications based on the toolkit.

* Amazon Web Services hired me and hard-forked this project in 2010. It became the AWS SDK for PHP.

### Rearden Commerce (now [Deem](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/deem)) ‚Äî Foster City, CA

#### Senior User Experience Developer (July 2008‚ÄîMarch 2010)

* Supported the _User Experience_ team, Java developers, and widget development teams by prototyping new features and integrating them into existing systems. Migrated JavaScript code from older frameworks to the [Yahoo! User Interface Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUI_Library) (YUI), enhancing codebase maintainability. Educated teams on the value of high-quality front-end code, placing a strong emphasis on writing code with better performance, faster load times, and improved accessibility across all projects.

### [WarpShare](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/warpshare) ‚Äî Morgan Hill, CA

#### Co-Founder and Chief Information Officer (September 2006‚ÄîMarch 2010)

WarpShare worked to bridge the gap between digital piracy and the economic models of RIAA and MPAA industry groups. Aimed to support musical artists and copyright holders by exploring innovative ways to derive value _from_ piracy. Recognized that piracy could not be entirely eliminated and analyzed the shortcomings of traditional anti-piracy efforts by the MPAA and RIAA.

Some things which happened later that either proved our premises true or false:

* Developed CleerPeer, an efficient peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol known as the "Hive-based Peer-to-Peer Network" ([US Patent US8103870B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8103870B2/en?inventor=Ryan+Parman)), which improved upon the performance and efficiency of existing protocols like BitTorrent. Addressed and solved multiple performance and efficiency issues present in the original BitTorrent protocol. Some of these enhancements were later reflected in BitTorrent Pro. [BitTorrent Inc.](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bittorrent) is still struggling to monetize the protocol.

* Contributed to early concepts in peer-to-peer (P2P) digital content delivery with CleerPeer (c. 2007). These ideas have since been realized in technologies like [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech), which empowers P2P-based distribution of digital content.

* Researched machine learning-powered content identification methods (c. 2007), which have since been successfully adopted by companies such as YouTube.

* Designed a [social network focused around digital media](https://www.flickr.com/photos/skyzyx/4256296410/in/album-72157623164675526/), incorporating gamification elements to enhance tagging and content improvement over automated data sources. Recognized that users enjoy keeping track of music, movies, and TV shows, discovering similar content, and sharing with friends. Drew inspiration from platforms like GetGlue (acquired by Yahoo), Letterboxd, IMDb, Trakt.tv, and Plex to create an engaging and interactive user experience.

* Pioneered an innovative business model (c. 2008) enabling users and brands to support and sponsor content through interactive advertising integrated into the media experience (e.g., content-targeted advertising, a smarter version of _sponsorships_).

  * Designed ads to be _part of the content_, avoiding _interruptions_ common with pre-roll and mid-roll ads used by platforms like YouTube at the time. (Apple pursued similar advertising concepts with their [iAd service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAd) (2010), aiming to transform advertising into an experiential medium.)

  * Brands sponsored downloads by paying 99¬¢ per song, held in escrow for the benefit of copyright owners (or donated to charity) in exchange for social engagement, offering an ethical approach to digital content monetization via ‚Äúpiracy‚Äù. (For end-users, it is similar to _sponsorships_ of today.)

  * [Readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability_(service)) (c. 2009) implemented a similar business model for written content (e.g., blogs), but kept any unclaimed funds. Public backlash led to them shutting down in 2016.

  * We didn't foresee the shift from piracy to streaming services like Pandora, Spotify, and Netflix.

* Failed because: team was too small; team lacked the required expertise in advertising; team lacked the required expertise in machine learning; funding dried up as the US entered the _credit crisis_ from 2007‚Äì2009; tried to do too much up-front; early mistakes spending money on _starting a company_ instead of developing a consumer product.
