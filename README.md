## Work Experience & Notable Projects

### [Northwood Labs](https://github.com/northwood-labs) ‚Äî Side Project

#### Owner (January 2024‚ÄîPresent)

* Northwood Labs is an incubator for some open-source and passive-income projects.

* **Custom Linux Packages:** Currently building a [repository of custom Linux packages](https://github.com/northwood-labs/package-building/wiki) for the matrix of Alpine Linux, Amazon Linux, and Ubuntu Linux across `x86_64` and `arm64` architectures, that can be added as a standard repository definition and installed via the system's package manager.

* **CSP Evaluator:** Currently building a [parser and evaluator for Content Security Policy (CSP) directives](https://github.com/northwood-labs/csp-parser) in Go.

* **Terraform Provider:** Built a Go library of functionality which (I believe) should have been built-in to Terraform/OpenTofu, then wrapped it in a [custom Provider](https://github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc). Having this functionality exposed as Go code, [Data Sources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources), and [Provider-defined Functions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/functions), makes it easier to write integration tests with [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io), ensuring with identical implementations.

* **Multi-Platform Docker:** Built a [downloader for GitHub release assets](https://github.com/northwood-labs/download-asset) which helps streamline the ability for a Dockerfile to pull the correct build of a release for the right OS/Arch. Simplifies building multi-platform images.

* **AWS Organization Security:** AWS has a pattern for multi-account organizations which they call ‚Äúhub and spoke.‚Äù Built a [library + CLI tool](https://github.com/northwood-labs/assume-spoke-role) which simplifies the process of traversing the hub-and-spoke in order to execute a command on the spoke account using the same methodology an any automated process would.

* **AWS Session Manager:** The terminal is the right tool for shell sessions. Built a [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) for [simplifying the ability to connect to an SSM-enabled EC2 instance](https://github.com/northwood-labs/ssm-shell) using your Terminal.

* **Configuration for `tflint`:** Built a [tool for generating up-to-date configurations for AWS/GCP/Azure](https://github.com/northwood-labs/tflint-config-generator) for use with [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint). The `tflint` software helps identify security and best-practice errors in Terraform/OpenTofu code.

* As development teams transitioned to [Full-Cycle Development](https://netflixtechblog.com/full-cycle-developers-at-netflix-a08c31f83249), led the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team in addressing macro-oriented problems affecting over 75 decentralized, heterogeneous engineering teams across the company. These initiatives empowered greater self-service for engineering teams, enabling them to move faster without reinventing the wheel.

* **Managing humans:** Managed a team of four ‚Äî one full-time and three contractors. Unfortunately, the team was spread thinly, and I _also_ had to pick-up several hands-on engineering tasks to keep up with our workload. Ultimately, I was pulled back into engineering in my subsequent role because there was a greater need for me there.

* **ECS-optimized Amazon Linux Base AMI:** Customized the AWS-provided AMIs to comply with Level-2 CIS Guidelines for both Amazon Linux and Docker. Collaborated closely with cybersecurity, operations, and various business units to ensure compliance. Achieved high levels of opt-in adoption, enhancing confidence among cybersecurity and operations organizations in the product development teams.

### [Amazon](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/amazon-web-services) ‚Äî Seattle, WA

#### Web Development Engineer II, Amazon Web Services (March 2010‚ÄîApril 2014)

* Hired by Amazon to work on the [AWS SDK for PHP](https://github.com/amazonwebservices/aws-sdk-for-php) after they hard-forked my open-source CloudFusion project. Invested heavily in supporting developers by actively listening to their needs, engaging with the community, and representing AWS in PHP-related industry groups.

* Collaborated with the [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) team to provide PHP support for the platform, which launched in March 2012. Worked closely with the PHP community to determine a PHP environment that would accommodate the needs of the broadest range of developers.

* Developed a rigorous internal test suite for testing Elastic Beanstalk environments, which became the foundation for testing by other language-specific teams. Contributed early input on adding support for `git push` deployments.

* Played a key role in the creation and development of the [AWS SDK for PHP v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php), incorporating significant changes in the PHP language and community since CloudFusion was first written in 2005. Contributed to the successful launch of the new SDK in November 2012.

* Collaborated with the AWS Design team on the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com), leveraging experience as a web developer and software engineer to bridge the gap between design and engineering disciplines. Contributed to building a high-quality, robust, and user-friendly console for interacting with Amazon Web Services.

* Came up with the idea for what would eventually become AWS Lambda in 2010. Spent 3 years pitching the idea to anyone inside of AWS who would listen, before meeting with the eventual manager of the AWS Lambda team.

* Spending much of my time focusing on Amazon‚Äôs _Customer Obsession_ leadership principle, I successfully pushed for meeting developers _where they already are_, and being better stewards of our community:

  * an SDK for both web browsers and Node.js
  * publishing AWS SDKs on GitHub; open-sourcing SDKs with the Apache 2.0 license
  * development of non-secret SDK improvements to happen in the open
  * the underlying AWS service models became exposed to end-users
  * the creation of <https://github.com/awslabs> to exist as a place for _unofficial_ AWS projects
  * "waiter" functions that are now commonplace in the AWS SDKs and AWS CLI
  * AWS development blogs and Twitter accounts
  * the ability for AWS employees to answer questions on StackOverflow

* Improved internal security by successfully getting the Console, SDK, and Development Tools teams to stop using the same set of AWS root credentials across the entire department.

* Led one of the first teams to provide reusable UI building blocks for creating AWS service consoles. This was in the Bootstrap-like era of AWS Consoles.

### CloudFusion (n√©e Tarzan) ‚Äî Open-Source Project

#### Creator and Developer (Early 2005‚ÄîMarch 2010)

* Developed CloudFusion, a fast and powerful PHP toolkit for rapidly building cloud-based web applications.

* Prioritized design decisions that enhanced performance, ease of use, and overall usability.

* Aimed to provide a high-performance developer toolkit for leveraging Amazon's cloud infrastructure, fostering community growth, and building useful, user-centric applications based on the toolkit.

* Amazon Web Services hired me and hard-forked this project in 2010. It became the AWS SDK for PHP.

### Rearden Commerce (now [Deem](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/deem)) ‚Äî Foster City, CA

#### Senior User Experience Developer (July 2008‚ÄîMarch 2010)

* Supported the _User Experience_ team, Java developers, and widget development teams by prototyping new features and integrating them into existing systems.

* Migrated JavaScript code from older frameworks to the [Yahoo! User Interface Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUI_Library) (YUI), enhancing codebase maintainability.

* Educated teams on the value of high-quality front-end code, placing a strong emphasis on writing code with better performance, faster load times, and improved accessibility across all projects.

### [WarpShare](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/warpshare) ‚Äî Morgan Hill, CA

#### Co-Founder and Chief Information Officer (September 2006‚ÄîMarch 2010)

* WarpShare worked to bridge the gap between digital piracy and the economic models of RIAA and MPAA industry groups.

* Aimed to support musical artists and copyright holders by exploring innovative ways to derive value _from_ piracy.

* Recognized that piracy could not be entirely eliminated and analyzed the shortcomings of traditional anti-piracy efforts by the MPAA and RIAA.

* Developed CleerPeer, an efficient peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol, which improved upon the performance and efficiency of existing protocols like BitTorrent. Addressed and solved multiple performance and efficiency issues present in the original [BitTorrent protocol](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0000.html). (U.S. Patent filing US8103870B2 [‚ÄúHive-based Peer-to-Peer Network‚Äù](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8103870B2/en?inventor=Ryan+Parman).)

* Contributed to early concepts in peer-to-peer (P2P) digital content delivery with CleerPeer (c. 2007). These ideas have since been realized in technologies like [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech), which empowers P2P-based distribution of digital content.

* Researched machine learning-powered content identification methods (c. 2007), which have since been successfully adopted by companies such as YouTube.

* Designed a [social network focused around digital media](https://www.flickr.com/photos/skyzyx/4256296410/in/album-72157623164675526/), incorporating gamification elements to enhance tagging and content improvement over automated data sources. Recognized that users enjoy keeping track of music, movies, and TV shows, discovering similar content, and sharing with friends. Drew inspiration from platforms like GetGlue (acquired by Yahoo), Letterboxd, IMDb, Trakt.tv, and Plex to create an engaging and interactive user experience.

* Pioneered an innovative business model (c. 2008) enabling users and brands to support and sponsor content through interactive advertising integrated into the media experience (e.g., content-targeted advertising, a smarter version of _sponsorships_).

  * Designed ads to be _part of the content_, avoiding _interruptions_ common with pre-roll and mid-roll ads used by platforms like YouTube at the time. (Apple pursued similar advertising concepts with their [iAd service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAd) (2010), aiming to transform advertising into an experiential medium.)

  * Brands sponsored downloads by paying 99¬¢ per song, held in escrow for the benefit of copyright owners (or donated to charity) in exchange for social engagement, offering an ethical approach to digital content monetization via ‚Äúpiracy‚Äù. (For end-users, it is similar to _sponsorships_ of today.)

  * [Readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability_(service)) (c. 2009) implemented a similar business model for written content (e.g., blogs), but kept any unclaimed funds. Public backlash led to them shutting down in 2016.

  * We didn't foresee the shift from piracy to streaming services like Pandora, Spotify, and Netflix.

* Failed because: team was too small; team lacked the required expertise in advertising; team lacked the required expertise in machine learning; funding dried up as the US entered the _credit crisis_ from 2007‚Äì2009; tried to do too much up-front; early mistakes spending money on _starting a company_ instead of developing a consumer product.

### [SimplePie](http://simplepie.org) ‚Äî Open-Source Project

#### Creator and Co-Developer (July 2004‚ÄîOctober 2009)
