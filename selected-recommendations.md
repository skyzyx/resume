## [Todd Staples](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddstaples/)

Director of Site Reliability & Observability Engineering

> I've had the absolute privilege to work/grind/solution in the trenches with Ryan at McGraw Hill. I started as a senior SRE and as soon as I met Ryan I instantly realized that he could be a solid mentor for me to learn the space (it was my first time being an SRE). Throughout our 6 or so years together Ryan did become that mentor, and he taught me a TON. I've worked on many projects with Ryan, and used many pieces of software he's written single-handedly. After all of that, I still have nothing but positive things to say about him as a person and a colleague.
>
> Ryan's knowledge of the space coupled with a fantastic attitude and innate desire to help no matter what it is, makes Ryan a fantastic addition to any team. If you're reading this, and have a chance to hire Ryan. Do like Nike says… "Just do it". He will only add value to anything he works on/is consulted on. But more than that, he'll ensure he documents it all really well, supports anyone that needs it, and is always welcoming on any conversations or feedback about it.
>
> Ryan's knowledge space (at least as far as i've seen) is across the spectrum. Dev, Cloud, CloudDev, DevOps, SecOps, Automation, Systems Design, Systems Arch,  etc. He sees the big picture, but can drop right down into the detail with anyone. If he doesn't know it… give him a day.
>
> I also want to comment a bit on Ryan's character, personality and soft skills. Ryan is calm, thoughtful, respectful, well spoken, intelligent, informed, and kind. He navigates through turmoil like a seasoned naval captain with nerves of steel, and Ryan's constant positive attitude is infectious and seems to boost team morale almost by osmosis. He believes that with a work, an organization can become world class and reach unheard of levels of reliability, availability, and fault tolerance. It's an inspiring notion.
>
> Ryan is top brass in my book.

## [Daevid Vincent](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daevid/)

### Senior Software Engineer, McGraw Hill

> Ryan is one of the most intelligent people I've ever had the pleasure of working with and being mentored by.
>
> I thought I knew some things until I met him. He taught this old dog so many new tricks. My entire way of thinking has changed. My skills have grown in ways I didn't even know existed. He implemented so many things that seem common sense in hindsight but without his drive, persistence and devotion to improving the processes they would most likely never have come to fruition. From Terraform to Docker to micro-services and even documentation, he brought me and our company into the 22nd century.
>
> His mastery of such a diverse pallet of software and technologies is admirable and aspiring. I honestly don't know where he gets the time! I was devastated when his departure was announced, but I'm glad to call him a friend; so we'll always stay in touch outside of work. Any company he chooses is lucky to have him on their team.
>
> In the entrepreneurial world, there are companies known as "unicorns"; RyRy is a unicorn unto himself.

## [Andy Winslow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andywins/)

### Big Data Platform Engineer, McGraw Hill

> Ryan has helped deliver countless positive outcomes here at McGraw-Hill. The quality of his solutions, his coding, his documentation… they're all exceptional. When he engages in solving a particular business problem Ryan dives deep into all of the relevant domains and masters them. Even if it's a new tool or technique that he was previously unfamiliar with you can count on him to quickly get up to speed. You can ask him to tackle pretty much any problem and know that the solution is in good hands. Whether your problem is the humans or the machines, he can help.
>
> If the highest form of praise for an engineer is to describe their impact, then I'll offer to you that Ryan has made a tremendous difference here that countless coworkers have felt and appreciated. If the highest form of praise for a human being is to describe the relationships formed, then I'll offer to you that Ryan made many good friends here and he will be missed. Whatever form of praise you prefer, Ryan has more than earned it. He is a rock star.

### Technical Account Manager, AWS

> During my time with McGraw-Hill, Ryan was the person I tried to follow as much as I could. He sets a high bar for others to follow, and in my opinion, it made a big impact on different levels in the company. I learned a lot about best SRE practices by reading his documentation, by looking over Ryan's code in repos, in conversations and during weekly/bi-weekly team meetings and demos.
>
> Also, when included in hiring interviews, it was great to read Ryan's logical and well structured feedback that made a lot of sense, and made hiring decisions easier.
