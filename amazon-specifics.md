# Additional specifics from my time at Amazon

As part of my role on the SDK team at AWS, I fought for the user at every opportunity against the cultural inertia that existed at the time. I successfully pushed for:

* an SDK for both web browsers and Node.js
* publishing AWS SDKs on GitHub; open-sourcing SDKs with the Apache 2.0 license
* development of non-secret SDK improvements to happen in the open
* the underlying AWS service models became exposed to end-users
* the creation of <https://github.com/awslabs> to exist as a place for _unofficial_ AWS projects
* "waiter" functions that are now commonplace in the AWS SDKs and AWS CLI
* AWS development blogs and Twitter accounts
* the ability for AWS employees to answer questions on StackOverflow
