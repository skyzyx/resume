# Additional specifics from my time at Amazon

As part of my role on the SDK team at AWS, I fought for the user at every opportunity against the cultural inertia that existed at the time. I successfully pushed/lobbied for:

* an SDK for both [web browsers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/getting-started-browser.html) and [Node.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/welcome.html)
* publishing [AWS SDKs on GitHub](https://aws.github.io); open-sourcing SDKs with the Apache 2.0 license (formerly used the [Amazon Software License](https://aws.amazon.com/asl/))
* development of _non-secret_ SDK improvements to happen in the open
* the underlying [AWS service models](https://smithy.io/2.0/) became exposed to end-users (as [JSON](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/tree/main/codegen/sdk-codegen/aws-models))
* the creation of <https://github.com/awslabs> to exist as a place for _unofficial_ AWS projects
* [waiter functions](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/wait/index.html) that are now commonplace in the AWS SDKs and AWS CLI
* [AWS development blogs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/) and [Twitter accounts](https://twitter.com/awsforjava)
* the ability for AWS employees to answer questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws)
